Workshops on Open Science topics will be given in the morning of the first day.
We are currently accepting proposals for 45- or 90-minute workshops.

## Guidelines for workshop proposals

When preparing the description of you workshop, make sure to include the following:

- what’s in it for the participants
- what’s the main (learning) objective of the workshop
- what interactive format will be used”.
