Workshops on Open Science topics will be given in the morning of the first day.
We are currently [accepting proposals](registration.qmd#workshop-hosts) for 45-
or 90-minute workshops.
The main goal of the workshops is to help participants become more comfortable
in practicing Open Research, and provide an introduction to, or a more advanced exploration of,
available resources and open source tools. These can be specific to archaeology
or more general resources.

## Guidelines for workshop proposals

When preparing the description of your workshop (maximum of 200 words),
make sure to include the following:

- what’s in it for the participants
- what’s the main (learning) objective of the workshop
- what interactive format will be used
- what are the prerequisites (if any)
