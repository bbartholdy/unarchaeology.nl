During the unconference we also hope to improve awareness of Open Science in archaeology, as well as to help people convert awareness into practice by offering skill-up workshops and developing basic guidelines for practising and teaching Open Science.\nBy bringing together experienced Open Science practitioners with researchers who are interested in employing Open Science in their research but don’t know where to begin, we will identify the needs of novice practitioners and develop useful guidelines for getting started with Open Science in archaeology.\nBy organising an event specifically focused on Open Science as opposed to field-specific topics, we aim to bring together people from across archaeological subdisciplines who normally don’t have a platform for collaboration.\nThe themes for the unconference will be Education, focusing on developing guidelines and integrating Open Science in the regular curricula, and AI, specifically concerning the ethics and reproducibility of its use in archaeology.",

Participants are at the center of the Unconference, where the content of the conference is largely defined by what participants want to see (with a predefined overarching theme). An Unconference also encourages collaboration, whether this is collaboratively deciding on the topics for discussion, or co-creating output documents resulting from Unconference sessions.\nThe event will consist of morning workshops that will provide training in various Open Science-related skills. During lunch, there will be a marketplace where Open Science related communities, infrastructures, etc., will have the opportunity to set up a booth and interact with the participants of the event. The afternoon will consist of presentations by participants, on topics chosen by the participants, followed by discussion sessions for the presentations and additional discussion topics (including AI in archaeology). The end of the first day will consist of a brainstorming session where participants will come up with ideas for outputs for the Unconference, followed by drinks and networking. The second half-day will be a hackathon, where those interested will work on the Unconference outputs suggested during the brainstorming session of the previous day.",
