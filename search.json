The main goal of the workshops is to help participants become more comfortable in practicing Open Research, and provide an introduction to, or a more advanced exploration of, available resources and open source tools. These can be specific to archaeology or more general resources.\nYou can register for the workshop you want to join during registration.",

    "text": "Workshop topics\n\nMaking your graphs and plots reproducible with Python\nHost: Alex Brandsen\nWant to make beautiful graphs, that scale well in publications? Hate making graphs in Excel, and want to easily adapt to new data? Then this is the workshop for you! Learn the basics of Python (no experience needed), load in some tabular data, and learn how to make reproducible graphs and plots.\n\n\nCan we openly share archaeological location data?\nHosts: Pascal Flohr & Adam Benfer\nPublishing research data openly is an important part of Open Science and helps to make data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). However, FAIR data is not necessarily open, and sensitive data (like personal data) does not have to, and should not, be shared openly. Location data can potentially be harmful to share -think of increased looting- but at the same time it is essential to understand and reuse many archaeological datasets. So how to strike the balance here between being as open as possible and as closed as necessary?\nIn this interactive workshop we will focus on finding solutions to this question. We look at other fields where this is relevant, like ecology (location of endangered species) and how they are dealing with this, as well as several archaeological case studies. This will form a framework for deciding if location data can be fully published or should be (partially) obscured. We will then introduce potential practical solutions to obscuring location data to different levels and finally discuss with the participants how to establish agreements and maintain trust when working with international partners.\n\n\nConvert Archaeological Data to RDF\nHost: Alexandre Peixe\nHave you ever seen data represented as a knowledge graph and asked yourself, “How do they do that?” It’s your lucky day! This workshop is perfect for you! Join us to learn how to feed your data into a knowledge graph using OntoText Refine and visualize it with GraphDB. You can even bring your data, and by the end, we can brainstorm together how it could be shaped into a format that improves context and relationship visualization and may allow enhanced data integration and retrieval.\n\n\nGeoreferencing archaeological plans with Allmaps\nHost: Jules Schoonman\nMany historical archaeological publications have been digitized by libraries and archives around the world. If such institutions support the standards of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) these resources can be georeferenced using the open source tools of Allmaps. This workshop will guide you through the process, using the collection of digitized archaeological literature of Heidelberg University as an example. It will include a demonstration of opening a resource in QGIS using the XYZ tile proxy.",

During the unconference we also hope to improve awareness of Open Science in archaeology, as well as to help people convert awareness into practice by offering skill-up workshops and developing basic guidelines for practising and teaching Open Science.\nBy bringing together experienced Open Science practitioners with researchers who are interested in employing Open Science in their research but don’t know where to begin, we will identify the needs of novice practitioners and develop useful guidelines for getting started with Open Science in archaeology.\nBy organising an event specifically focused on Open Science as opposed to field-specific topics, we aim to bring together people from across archaeological subdisciplines who normally don’t have a platform for collaboration.\nThe themes for the unconference will be Education, focusing on developing guidelines and integrating Open Science in the regular curricula, and AI, specifically concerning the ethics and reproducibility of its use in archaeology.",

Participants are at the center of the Unconference, where the content of the conference is largely defined by what participants want to see (with a predefined overarching theme). An Unconference also encourages collaboration, whether this is collaboratively deciding on the topics for discussion, or co-creating output documents resulting from Unconference sessions.\nThe event will consist of morning workshops that will provide training in various Open Science-related skills. During lunch, there will be a marketplace where Open Science related communities, infrastructures, etc., will have the opportunity to set up a booth and interact with the participants of the event. The afternoon will consist of presentations by participants, on topics chosen by the participants, followed by discussion sessions for the presentations and additional discussion topics (including AI in archaeology). The end of the first day will consist of a brainstorming session where participants will come up with ideas for outputs for the Unconference, followed by drinks and networking. The second half-day will be a hackathon, where those interested will work on the Unconference outputs suggested during the brainstorming session of the previous day.",
